# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We employed different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The ultimate goal is to predict credit risk. We're going to evaluate the performance of each model and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
